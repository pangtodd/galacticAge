Galactic Age

#### By Todd Pangilinan

Project developing business logic that calculates a person's age on different planets.

## Technologies used:

* npm
* Jest
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* markdown
* eslint
* babellrc

## Description:
This project focuses on the business logic- and testing of business logic- for an object which can be used to take a person's age and calculate their age on different planets. In addition to calculating someone's age on a different planet, the application can also estimate a person's life expetency on earth, calculate how many years they have left based on that number, and then extrapolate those estimates for other planets.

This project assumes the user inputs will be age, gender, smoker/tobacco use status, and regular exercise status. These inputs will be stored in the object, and then used to calculate the different estimates for life expectency, age on different planets, and how much time users have on different planets.
